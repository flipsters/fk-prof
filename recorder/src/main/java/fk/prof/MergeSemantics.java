      Coverage implications:
      
      Meaning of coverage changes depending on the chosen merge semantic for a particular ctx. Eg. if we enter ctx P followed by Q, and if both has 10% coverage,
      it doesn't make sense to double-filter, because 1/10 * 1/10 = 1/100, so for scoped capture "P > Q" user will have to understand that only 1% coverage is being reported. This is confusing at the best and useless in the worst case. 
      So instead of double-filtering, we directly control filtering in a sane/least-surprise way, by auto-choosing filtering mode depending on the user-chosen merge-semantic. There are 2 filtering modes, we document the chosen mode inline with enum constant.
      Filter-mode:
      FM_parent - Ignore coverage value specified by child, simply record as if parent-ctx is directly controlling filtering for child. In this case, child records if parent records. However, when the same context appears as parent-context by itself, coverage value is respected.
      FM_child - Ignore coverage value specified by the parent, simply record as if parent-ctx doesn't exist.

Also, note that its easy to violate the upper-limit on number of contexts to be tracked using this merge-semantic, which leads to data-loss, so this must be used with care.
